A little about me [adapted from](https://cilearn.csuci.edu/courses/16292/pages/meet-your-instructor?module_item_id=757363):
- I got my HS diploma from the High School at Moorpark College. I'm
  working on a BS in Mathematics and Computer Science here at CSUCI.
- I have no cats.
- When I'm not working or studying, I like playing chess, listening to
  and singing along with sea shanties, and reading *Hacker News* and
  *The Economist*. I'm quite good at swimming. I'm really trying to
  get good at running.
- Ryan gives the following disclaimer, but trust me I'm worse.
	>I care about all of you and want every single one of you to
	>succeed in my class. Sometimes it takes me a minute to remember
	>my own name, or what "watermelons" are called. Please don't be
	>offended if I forget your name! I'll remember your shining face
	>and our discussions (and I'll remember them better if you turn
	>your camera on, but no pressure shy people).
