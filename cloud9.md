- Follow Ryan's guide.
- Files and folders are case sensitive.
- Don't use Safari.
- Put your labs in folders. Don't just put everything in the same folder.

```Java
// Here is the code for HelloWorld
class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

- Try compiling and running. 
- Submit a zip file containing the code and a screenshot. Do not
  include `.class` files, only the screenshot and the human-readable
  `.java` files.
